										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Installing an electric fence is one thing, but maintaining it, is another. Saxmoore Services offers a wide variety of Maintenance Contracts with options to ensure that your electric fence always feels electric.</p>
<h4><u>What?</u></h4>
<p>You need to make sure that your electric fence is working at 100% to ensure the safety of your family and household goods. Maintenance contracts that offer a full monthly perimeter inspection of your electric fence and breach report can help you do this. Another way is removing any faults and potential faults from your electric fencing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-249 aligncenter" src="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-20161111_155342-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="127" height="226" srcset="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-20161111_155342-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-20161111_155342.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 127px) 100vw, 127px" /></p>
<h4><u>Maintenance Contracts for Who?</u></h4>
<p>You don’t have to be an expert on electric fencing to maintain it though. Saxmoore can do it for you. From perimeter inspection to removing of faults, tensioning of electric fencing wires, replacing of broken bobbins, hooks and springs, clearing of foliage (excluding grass cutting), voltage tests and reports on electric fencing as well as alarm testing and reports. We also test and replace batteries on electric fence energizers.</p>
<h4><u>Wait!</u></h4>
<p>But wait! There’s more… our maintenance contracts include 1 free call out per month over and above monthly inspection. And because Saxmoore likes to go the extra mile, we offer painting of posts on a free-standing fence where rust is detected and a monthly report sent via email.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-220 aligncenter" src="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-2833-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-2833-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-2833-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-2833.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Electric fencing is undoubtedly one of the most sort after security measures and protection barriers for household and industrial areas. However, certain laws have been put in place to prevent electric fences from being lethal. Let’s have a closer look at the law behind the electric fence.</p>
<p>In October 2012, laws came into effect from government, relating to non-lethal electric fencing. Electric fences can be very dangerous if contact is made with them. However, there are other aspects that promoted theses laws apart from human injury. Poorly installed electric fencing systems seemed to cause interference among Telkom, T.V. and wireless connections. The law also meant that the standard of installation was increased and poor quality, potentially harmful products, were eliminated.</p>
<h4><strong>The Law in detail </strong></h4>
<p>There are numerous clauses pertaining to this legislation and can all be found under Electrical Machinery Regulations 2011, Schedule 12, electric fencing. There are some very important aspects to take note of though. Issuing of a COC, legal requirements of property sales and public areas.</p>
<h4><strong>What you need to know</strong></h4>
<p>A COC is a Certificate of Compliance and after October 2012, the law stated that any electric fence that was erected had to have a COC issued by the person registered with the Department of Labour.  Although anyone can erect an electric fence, only a registered installer can issue a COC.</p>
<p>A COC is valid indefinitely once issued. After October 2012, any property sold that has an electric fence around it must be sold with a COC and it must be less than 2 years old for transfer to be registered. This means that property owners need to ensure that their electric fence structures are up to COC standard and maintained every 2 years thereafter.</p>
<p>The law behind electric fencing also states that public areas now need to be protected where there is an electric fence present. A public area in this case has been defined by SANS as a secure area to which any person can gain legal access. This is without consent from the owner or where members of the public can enter, e.g. a sports ground. The law recommends having a physical barrier between the electric fence and public at least 1.5m high and 1 width of the opening be 150mm.</p>
<p>These laws can be scary and seem impossible to comply with. We at Saxmoore are certified installers of electric fencing and issue COC certificates. For a free quote, call or email us today. Let us reinforce the law behind your electric fence.</p>
