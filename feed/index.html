										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Installing an electric fence is one thing, but maintaining it, is another. Saxmoore Services offers a wide variety of Maintenance Contracts with options to ensure that your electric fence always feels electric.</p>
<h4><u>What?</u></h4>
<p>You need to make sure that your electric fence is working at 100% to ensure the safety of your family and household goods. Maintenance contracts that offer a full monthly perimeter inspection of your electric fence and breach report can help you do this. Another way is removing any faults and potential faults from your electric fencing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-249 aligncenter" src="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-20161111_155342-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="127" height="226" srcset="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-20161111_155342-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-20161111_155342.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 127px) 100vw, 127px" /></p>
<h4><u>Maintenance Contracts for Who?</u></h4>
<p>You don’t have to be an expert on electric fencing to maintain it though. Saxmoore can do it for you. From perimeter inspection to removing of faults, tensioning of electric fencing wires, replacing of broken bobbins, hooks and springs, clearing of foliage (excluding grass cutting), voltage tests and reports on electric fencing as well as alarm testing and reports. We also test and replace batteries on electric fence energizers.</p>
<h4><u>Wait!</u></h4>
<p>But wait! There’s more… our maintenance contracts include 1 free call out per month over and above monthly inspection. And because Saxmoore likes to go the extra mile, we offer painting of posts on a free-standing fence where rust is detected and a monthly report sent via email.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-220 aligncenter" src="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-2833-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-2833-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-2833-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/electric-fence-2833.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Electric fencing is undoubtedly one of the most sort after security measures and protection barriers for household and industrial areas. However, certain laws have been put in place to prevent electric fences from being lethal. Let’s have a closer look at the law behind the electric fence.</p>
<p>In October 2012, laws came into effect from government, relating to non-lethal electric fencing. Electric fences can be very dangerous if contact is made with them. However, there are other aspects that promoted theses laws apart from human injury. Poorly installed electric fencing systems seemed to cause interference among Telkom, T.V. and wireless connections. The law also meant that the standard of installation was increased and poor quality, potentially harmful products, were eliminated.</p>
<h4><strong>The Law in detail </strong></h4>
<p>There are numerous clauses pertaining to this legislation and can all be found under Electrical Machinery Regulations 2011, Schedule 12, electric fencing. There are some very important aspects to take note of though. Issuing of a COC, legal requirements of property sales and public areas.</p>
<h4><strong>What you need to know</strong></h4>
<p>A COC is a Certificate of Compliance and after October 2012, the law stated that any electric fence that was erected had to have a COC issued by the person registered with the Department of Labour.  Although anyone can erect an electric fence, only a registered installer can issue a COC.</p>
<p>A COC is valid indefinitely once issued. After October 2012, any property sold that has an electric fence around it must be sold with a COC and it must be less than 2 years old for transfer to be registered. This means that property owners need to ensure that their electric fence structures are up to COC standard and maintained every 2 years thereafter.</p>
<p>The law behind electric fencing also states that public areas now need to be protected where there is an electric fence present. A public area in this case has been defined by SANS as a secure area to which any person can gain legal access. This is without consent from the owner or where members of the public can enter, e.g. a sports ground. The law recommends having a physical barrier between the electric fence and public at least 1.5m high and 1 width of the opening be 150mm.</p>
<p>These laws can be scary and seem impossible to comply with. We at Saxmoore are certified installers of electric fencing and issue COC certificates. For a free quote, call or email us today. Let us reinforce the law behind your electric fence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s so common these days, we don’t even feel shocked when we hear or read about it. Yes, house break-ins are on the rise. But Saxmoore Services has compiled a list of the top 10 most effective security measures SA home owners can implement to ensure that their homes are protected. After all, prevention is way better than cure.</p>
<h4>1. Motorized Gates</h4>
<p>It may be costly to install at first, but well worth the spend in the long run. Motor operated gates are easily opened while you remain safe in your car. Also making life much easier when it’s raining outside.</p>
<h4>2. Fencing</h4>
<p>Making sure that your property is fenced off doesn’t just assist in security measures. Your neighbours can also clearly see your perimeter and your portion of the property. An electric fence or wall is just another hiccup for any intruders thinking they have easy access to your home. The more hiccups, the less likely they willing to try and enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-265 aligncenter" src="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/clear-view-20160426_125458-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="136" srcset="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/clear-view-20160426_125458-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/clear-view-20160426_125458-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/clear-view-20160426_125458.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Lighting</h4>
<p>Thieves like darkness as it provides the perfect cover for a house burglary. Always check that your yard is well lite up, especially leading up the driveway and to the front door. Too much lighting can create a catch 22, however with the various options today, you can avoid unwanted attention. Invest in sensor lights, that go on when motion is detected. Or a timer that allows the lights in the house to come on at a certain time every day.</p>
<h4>4. Windows</h4>
<p>We all tend to forget certain things at some point and with our busy lives, it’s even harder to remember the small things. Get yourself in a routine of checking that the windows are closed and locked before going to bed. When opening your windows during the day, don’t open them wider than necessary. Thieves look for easy access points in homes and believe it or not, an open window is always first option. It’s also important to do a maintenance check on all your windows. Make sure they are not rusting or rotting away.</p>
<h4>5. Locks</h4>
<p>You might think that a cheaper lock will still do the job. And sometimes they do. But in the event of a burglary, a cheap lock will not stop intruders gaining access into your home. Spend a bit of extra money on a deadbolt, especially for your front door. Heavy duty locks are reliable security measures. Keep your spare keys in a safe place and away from common storage areas like under the mat outside the front door.</p>
<h4>6. Dogs</h4>
<p>A lot of people are afraid of dogs, including intruders. Depending on the type of dog you get, you can have an extra form of security without the high costs. A family pet will always alert the family against intruders and prevent them from getting closer to you than need be. Dogs also offer companionship and keep other intruders, like rats, at bay. Having more than one dog patrolling your perimeter will easily scare off any unwanted visitors.</p>
<h4>7. Safe Room</h4>
<p>As much as you try and prevent intruders from gaining access into your home, sometimes they make it in. It is important to know what to do in the event that you and your family are at home when thieves attack. Have a “safe room” in the house that you can easily get to but is secured with a slam lock gate or security gate. Have routine drills and practice from different areas in your home to make it to the “safe room”.</p>
<h4>8. Security System</h4>
<p>CCTV in and outside your home will help you know when someone is around your home, especially if they are not supposed to be. Alarm systems also make it harder for thieves to enter as they are scared off should they trigger it. Taking these extra security measures gives you peace of mind that your home and belongings are safer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-188 aligncenter" src="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG-20161123-WA0005-min-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="234" height="132" srcset="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG-20161123-WA0005-min-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG-20161123-WA0005-min-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG-20161123-WA0005-min-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG-20161123-WA0005-min.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>9. Positioning of valuables</h4>
<p>It’s difficult to always think “what does a thief see when they look at my home?” But such thinking can be the difference between a potential break-in and an actual break-in. Survey your home from the outside, especially at night. Can you see through the curtains, is your tv visible from the front door, can you hear the high-fi system playing in the street? Don’t make it obvious that you have expensive goods in your home. Keep such information to yourself.</p>
<h4>10. Routine</h4>
<ol start="10">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">Finally, get into the habit of doing routine checks in and around your home. Daily, make sure the garage door is closed, windows are closed before going to bed. The front, back and any other entrance door is locked. Test your alarm system once a month. Should it be faulty, get someone out to check immediately. Test your sensor lights and keep your yard maintained. Cut the grass and trim the trees. Thieves survey potential target homes and if they see that your aware of your surroundings, it makes it more difficult for them to enter.</li>
</ol>
<p>It may be a bit expensive when it comes to implementing these security measures, but you won’t regret it. You don’t want to find yourself in a situation where you wish you could have done more to prevent a break-in. And remember, Saxmoore Services offers you smart, safe, secure and reliable security options to suit any budget and home. No home is too big or small. Contact us today for a free quote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is not one person these days that can say, “I am not affected by crime.” Whether you have experienced a house robbery or hijacking, or someone you know and love has, we are all affected by the crime in our country.</p>
<p>SAPS posted their crime statistics from 2016/2017 in October 2017 and this was the conclusion. There were 22 343 reported house break ins from April 2016 to March 2017. An average of 61 houses were targeted per day during this period. It was also stated that 53% of people didn’t bother reporting the robbery, thinking that the police wouldn’t be able to help them. 16 717 hijacking incidents were recorded. An average of 46 cars were stolen everyday from 2016 to 2017.</p>
<h3><strong>The Cause </strong></h3>
<p>When researchers looked into hijackings, they found that most attempts and successful car thefts took place in the driveways of the victims. Such stats instill fear in many people as it seems we aren’t even safe in our place of comfort and leisure. Unfortunately, these are the times we live in and it is always better to be more cautious than to become an easy victim. Taking steps such as installing CCTV and alarm systems can be your life saver in the unfortunate event of a robbery or hijacking.</p>
<p>Always be vigilant when leaving and entering your driveway and house. Make sure that you have clear visibility of the street and surrounds, even if it means trimming a few trees and shrubs. When driving home after dark make sure that there are no suspicious people lurking around your area. If you think that you are being followed or feel uncomfortable about the car behind you, rather drive to a well lite up area or police station than going straight home. Make sure your house doors and car doors are locked always. With alarms and electric fencing, it is easy to become comfortable and think we are safe. It’s important to remember that thieves never sleep. They are always surveying and looking for every opportunity to attack and have the upper hand on you.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-397 aligncenter" src="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2395-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="141" srcset="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2395-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2395-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2395-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2395.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<h3><strong>How to Combat Crime&#8230;</strong></h3>
<p>To beat a thief, <strong>you</strong> need to start thinking like a thief. Look for “weak” spots in and around your home. It might be a broken window or faulty gate motor. You should make it a priority to fix these defaults before a thief discovers them. Change your route home to and from work from time to time. Don’t get stuck in bad habits like leaving your car unlocked in the driveway just because your property is fenced off. Remember, the thief is always watching, even if you can’t see them doing so. Don’t make it obvious when you’re not at home, especially at night. Make friends with your neighbours close by. It never hurts to have an extra pair of eyes looking after your property. Friendly eyes that is.</p>
<p>Crime is everywhere and whether we like it or not, it’s on the rise. Don’t be caught off guard by predators, Saxmoore is your one stop crime fighting solution. Contact us today for affordable quotes on electric fencing, CCTV and alarm systems.</p>

<p>Has your home ever been broken into? Were you at home when it happened? Or do you know of someone who’s house got broken into and all their valuable possessions were taken? Knowing that strangers can enter your property is a nerve-wracking thought! It raises a fear within you that cannot be silenc+ed.</p>
<p>If this is the case, your only option is to upgrade and improve your security with Electric Fencing in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>You might not think that you need some added security around your property, but even the tallest brick walls have proven to be no match for intruders. By installing Electric Fencing in Johannesburg, you can increase your security by 90% and deter even the most determined intruders.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples why added security will be more than beneficial to you.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Electric Fencing in Johannesburg:</h2>
<h4>1. Added Security</h4>
<p>Even if you already have an existing wall or palisades surrounding your property, you can add an Electric fence and not only heighten the security but add physical height to your perimeter, improving the quality of your wall or fence altogether. Saxmoore can be the reason you get a decent night’s sleep without worrying about the dangers out there.</p>
<h4>2. Aesthetic Value</h4>
<p>Electric Fencing in Johannesburg is ideal for properties that would benefit from a fence that allows the surrounding areas to be visible from inside the property; if you live on a farmland or on a property outside of town and you don’t want a brick wall, but you still require protection that would allow you to keep the view of your extended backyard, then Electric fencing is your answer. It will simultaneously give you the security you need and the visibility you want.</p>
<p>Another benefit of Electric fencing in Johannesburg is the visibility it offers companies in industrial areas; instead of concealing your business behind tall brick walls, you could be visible to the public by installing Electric fencing abound your buildings, keeping your assets and employees safe, as well as being practical for business purposes.</p>
<h4>3. Upgrade to your Property</h4>
<p>One of the most effective ways of adding value to your property is by adding security features. Clear view fencing in Johannesburg is a highly effective way of upgrading your property and increasing your resale value, should you plan on selling it one day. Saxmoore also has CCTV cameras and motorized gates which they supply and install.</p>
<h4>4. Protecting what’s Yours</h4>
<p>The obvious benefits of installing Electric fencing in Johannesburg are the security features it offers. With the crime rates being what they are in Gauteng, anybody is better off with electric fencing around their house or office. You want to be safe from burglars and intruders alike, why not invest in a quality electric fence.</p>
<h4>5. Save on Maintenance</h4>
<p>The materials used for Electric fencing are durable and low maintenance, meaning that you won’t need to replace any of the materials if you take good care of your fence. Shrubbery has to be trimmed back in order to keep the fence clear and the voltages have to be maintained at a certain level, but other than that, your clear view fence won’t cost you nearly as much in maintenance as other kinds of perimeters.</p>
<h4>6. Keep pets Save</h4>
<p>Not only will Saxmoore’s fences keep unwanted visitors out, it is highly effective in keeping pets or livestock inside your property as well. If you have dogs who you love and is also a part of your family, you might consider keeping them safe with electric fencing in Johannesburg. Some criminals have gone as far as poisoning dogs to gain access to properties – prevent this from happening by installing an effective barrier around your property to keep your pets safe.</p>
<p>There are many other benefits of Electric Fencing in Johannesburg, like the low costs involved with the installation which is also easier than traditional barriers. Saxmoore installs certified fences that guarantee their compliance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act 85, so you can rest assured that your property is properly protected against intruders.</p>
<p>Don’t think that it will never happen to you because crime does not discriminate – we all fall victim to it at some point, but you can prevent being part of the statistics of crime in Johannesburg. <a href="http://www.saxmoore.co.za/contact-us" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">Contact Saxmoore today for a quote and make your home as safe as can be</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Give your home the extra protection that it needs by installing reliable electric fence.</h1>
<p>I’m sure we all feel as though we are living in a Wild West country these days. Gunfights on the streets and daily news about how dangerous it is becoming out there really puts a damper on the way in which we live our lives. Our thoughts immediately turn to the worst case scenarios that our family could find themselves in should we not have all of the latest and greatest safety mechanisms in place. <a href="http://www.saxmoore.co.za/electric-fencing-installation/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">Electric fencing in Johannesburg</a> is really one of the few security measures that we absolutely need to have in place to have peace of mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a <strong>South African homeowner</strong> living in Johannesburg, the chances are that you already have an electric fence in place. And this is fantastic because you have recognized the importance of having electric fencing in Johannesburg to keep you and your family safe, or to keep your business safe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But did you know that once an electric fence has been installed, you will need to make sure that you keep an eye on it. I don’t need to tell you that the electric fence you install needs to be operating efficiently in order for it to serve its purpose of keeping you safe. Once you start feeling really secure, you might think that you can get away with turning it off or you might think that just because the fence is up but not on is enough to keep criminals at bay.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">You are wrong to think this and this is why</h3>
<p>Criminals are far more intelligent than you and I would like to think. Remember that they make a career out of stealing property and terrorizing people, often without even being seen and in South Africa we know that they do these illegal acts without ever being caught. So please don’t take comfort in thinking that the average criminal who is going to break into your home is anything less than a mastermind who is keeping a careful watch on your home as he plans his invasion.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The drawback of stealing a thing, is that one never knows how wonderful the thing that one steals is.”</em><br />
<em> &#8211; Oscar Wilde</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Criminals do not care about the sentimental value that you place on those items that they have stolen. They are only out to steal your valuables with the aim of selling them for as much as they can get. So protecting that which has a lot of valuable meaning to you is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>Criminals pay far more attention to your home than you would like to think. This very thought is enough to make us incredibly paranoid, when we have electric fencing in Johannesburg our peace of mind is returned to us. But you can only be confident of your protection if you make sure that your electric fencing is active.</p>
<h3>Now back to the average criminal being very clever in their current “profession”.</h3>
<p>They keep a look out for the Johannesburg electric fencing that is no longer working or being used and they especially keep a look out for the fencing that has been turned off. They know that if a person has turned off their fencing that they are likely to be feeling safe and that they have let their guard down.</p>
<p>How do they know that the fencing has been turned off? Well, as a South African you have probably heard that electrical clicking sound that comes from an active electric fence. While you might think that this means that there is something wrong with the fencing, it actually means that the fencing is doing its job.</p>
<p>And criminals know that when that gentle but menacing clicking stops, your electric fencing is no longer working. And this is when they start plotting their invasion of your home. How can you keep the thieves away? Make a conscious effort to always listen for the clicking. If one day you no longer hear that click, get on the phone to the company that installed the fence and ask for help. A broken electric fence can happen, although it is something that happens very rarely.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Electric-fencing-in-Johannesburg-is-great-for-use-around-homes-farms-and-businesses.jpg" alt="null" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other reason that the clicking of the fence might have stopped is because the fence has been turned off. Maybe you have decided that you want to start saving electricity. After all, you haven’t had any trouble with criminals and they won’t know that you have turned off the fence, right? But a criminal is going to see that your fence is no longer on and that your defenses are down. So while you might be saving electricity by turning off your fence, you are actually putting yourself at risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next thing that the not so sophisticated criminal is going to watch for is loose wires on your electric fence. Once they see that the wires have fallen down or become even slightly loose, they are immediately going to know that your fencing is broken and no longer effective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is when they take the opportunity to pounce.</p>
<h3>Attacking your fence</h3>
<p>Not all criminals are going to wait for your fence to break as they know that there is a great possibility of the fence never breaking and so they choose to physically attack the fencing. They take an object and they strike one or two insulators on the brackets with the aim of breaking them or they even go so far as to attack the wires. They then hide somewhere to see it the alarm goes off. You might be wondering just how you will be able to protect yourself when they do this. Taking the time to walk the perimeter of the fence once a week will help you in finding if there are places where the criminals are trying to get in. If you notice a break call the company which installed the fence as soon as possible to get it fixed.</p>
