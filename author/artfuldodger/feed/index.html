<p>Has your home ever been broken into? Were you at home when it happened? Or do you know of someone who’s house got broken into and all their valuable possessions were taken? Knowing that strangers can enter your property is a nerve-wracking thought! It raises a fear within you that cannot be silenc+ed.</p>
<p>If this is the case, your only option is to upgrade and improve your security with Electric Fencing in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>You might not think that you need some added security around your property, but even the tallest brick walls have proven to be no match for intruders. By installing Electric Fencing in Johannesburg, you can increase your security by 90% and deter even the most determined intruders.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples why added security will be more than beneficial to you.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Electric Fencing in Johannesburg:</h2>
<h4>1. Added Security</h4>
<p>Even if you already have an existing wall or palisades surrounding your property, you can add an Electric fence and not only heighten the security but add physical height to your perimeter, improving the quality of your wall or fence altogether. Saxmoore can be the reason you get a decent night’s sleep without worrying about the dangers out there.</p>
<h4>2. Aesthetic Value</h4>
<p>Electric Fencing in Johannesburg is ideal for properties that would benefit from a fence that allows the surrounding areas to be visible from inside the property; if you live on a farmland or on a property outside of town and you don’t want a brick wall, but you still require protection that would allow you to keep the view of your extended backyard, then Electric fencing is your answer. It will simultaneously give you the security you need and the visibility you want.</p>
<p>Another benefit of Electric fencing in Johannesburg is the visibility it offers companies in industrial areas; instead of concealing your business behind tall brick walls, you could be visible to the public by installing Electric fencing abound your buildings, keeping your assets and employees safe, as well as being practical for business purposes.</p>
<h4>3. Upgrade to your Property</h4>
<p>One of the most effective ways of adding value to your property is by adding security features. Clear view fencing in Johannesburg is a highly effective way of upgrading your property and increasing your resale value, should you plan on selling it one day. Saxmoore also has CCTV cameras and motorized gates which they supply and install.</p>
<h4>4. Protecting what’s Yours</h4>
<p>The obvious benefits of installing Electric fencing in Johannesburg are the security features it offers. With the crime rates being what they are in Gauteng, anybody is better off with electric fencing around their house or office. You want to be safe from burglars and intruders alike, why not invest in a quality electric fence.</p>
<h4>5. Save on Maintenance</h4>
<p>The materials used for Electric fencing are durable and low maintenance, meaning that you won’t need to replace any of the materials if you take good care of your fence. Shrubbery has to be trimmed back in order to keep the fence clear and the voltages have to be maintained at a certain level, but other than that, your clear view fence won’t cost you nearly as much in maintenance as other kinds of perimeters.</p>
<h4>6. Keep pets Save</h4>
<p>Not only will Saxmoore’s fences keep unwanted visitors out, it is highly effective in keeping pets or livestock inside your property as well. If you have dogs who you love and is also a part of your family, you might consider keeping them safe with electric fencing in Johannesburg. Some criminals have gone as far as poisoning dogs to gain access to properties – prevent this from happening by installing an effective barrier around your property to keep your pets safe.</p>
<p>There are many other benefits of Electric Fencing in Johannesburg, like the low costs involved with the installation which is also easier than traditional barriers. Saxmoore installs certified fences that guarantee their compliance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act 85, so you can rest assured that your property is properly protected against intruders.</p>
<p>Don’t think that it will never happen to you because crime does not discriminate – we all fall victim to it at some point, but you can prevent being part of the statistics of crime in Johannesburg. <a href="http://www.saxmoore.co.za/contact-us" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">Contact Saxmoore today for a quote and make your home as safe as can be</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Give your home the extra protection that it needs by installing reliable electric fence.</h1>
<p>I’m sure we all feel as though we are living in a Wild West country these days. Gunfights on the streets and daily news about how dangerous it is becoming out there really puts a damper on the way in which we live our lives. Our thoughts immediately turn to the worst case scenarios that our family could find themselves in should we not have all of the latest and greatest safety mechanisms in place. <a href="http://www.saxmoore.co.za/electric-fencing-installation/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">Electric fencing in Johannesburg</a> is really one of the few security measures that we absolutely need to have in place to have peace of mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a <strong>South African homeowner</strong> living in Johannesburg, the chances are that you already have an electric fence in place. And this is fantastic because you have recognized the importance of having electric fencing in Johannesburg to keep you and your family safe, or to keep your business safe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But did you know that once an electric fence has been installed, you will need to make sure that you keep an eye on it. I don’t need to tell you that the electric fence you install needs to be operating efficiently in order for it to serve its purpose of keeping you safe. Once you start feeling really secure, you might think that you can get away with turning it off or you might think that just because the fence is up but not on is enough to keep criminals at bay.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">You are wrong to think this and this is why</h3>
<p>Criminals are far more intelligent than you and I would like to think. Remember that they make a career out of stealing property and terrorizing people, often without even being seen and in South Africa we know that they do these illegal acts without ever being caught. So please don’t take comfort in thinking that the average criminal who is going to break into your home is anything less than a mastermind who is keeping a careful watch on your home as he plans his invasion.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The drawback of stealing a thing, is that one never knows how wonderful the thing that one steals is.”</em><br />
<em> &#8211; Oscar Wilde</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Criminals do not care about the sentimental value that you place on those items that they have stolen. They are only out to steal your valuables with the aim of selling them for as much as they can get. So protecting that which has a lot of valuable meaning to you is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>Criminals pay far more attention to your home than you would like to think. This very thought is enough to make us incredibly paranoid, when we have electric fencing in Johannesburg our peace of mind is returned to us. But you can only be confident of your protection if you make sure that your electric fencing is active.</p>
<h3>Now back to the average criminal being very clever in their current “profession”.</h3>
<p>They keep a look out for the Johannesburg electric fencing that is no longer working or being used and they especially keep a look out for the fencing that has been turned off. They know that if a person has turned off their fencing that they are likely to be feeling safe and that they have let their guard down.</p>
<p>How do they know that the fencing has been turned off? Well, as a South African you have probably heard that electrical clicking sound that comes from an active electric fence. While you might think that this means that there is something wrong with the fencing, it actually means that the fencing is doing its job.</p>
<p>And criminals know that when that gentle but menacing clicking stops, your electric fencing is no longer working. And this is when they start plotting their invasion of your home. How can you keep the thieves away? Make a conscious effort to always listen for the clicking. If one day you no longer hear that click, get on the phone to the company that installed the fence and ask for help. A broken electric fence can happen, although it is something that happens very rarely.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.saxmoore.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Electric-fencing-in-Johannesburg-is-great-for-use-around-homes-farms-and-businesses.jpg" alt="null" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other reason that the clicking of the fence might have stopped is because the fence has been turned off. Maybe you have decided that you want to start saving electricity. After all, you haven’t had any trouble with criminals and they won’t know that you have turned off the fence, right? But a criminal is going to see that your fence is no longer on and that your defenses are down. So while you might be saving electricity by turning off your fence, you are actually putting yourself at risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next thing that the not so sophisticated criminal is going to watch for is loose wires on your electric fence. Once they see that the wires have fallen down or become even slightly loose, they are immediately going to know that your fencing is broken and no longer effective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is when they take the opportunity to pounce.</p>
<h3>Attacking your fence</h3>
<p>Not all criminals are going to wait for your fence to break as they know that there is a great possibility of the fence never breaking and so they choose to physically attack the fencing. They take an object and they strike one or two insulators on the brackets with the aim of breaking them or they even go so far as to attack the wires. They then hide somewhere to see it the alarm goes off. You might be wondering just how you will be able to protect yourself when they do this. Taking the time to walk the perimeter of the fence once a week will help you in finding if there are places where the criminals are trying to get in. If you notice a break call the company which installed the fence as soon as possible to get it fixed.</p>
